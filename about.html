                    <p>Gamified. is a web project dedicated to providing designers with harnessing the knowledge and tools of implementing gamification into their projects.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h5>What is <i>Gamification</i>?</h5>
                    <p>According to <a href="https://www.gamify.com/what-is-gamification" target="_blank">Dr Zachary Fitz Walter</a> and most other sources, gamification refers to the application of game-design elements and game principles in non-game contexts.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Take for example, how your favourite frozen yogurt chain hands out stamp cards as a way to incentivise you to become a regular customer by issuing a task (e.g. making a visit) and promising a reward at certain milestones (e.g. complimentary toppings on your 3rd visit).</p>
                    <br>
                    <h5>Is gamification <i>ethical</i>?</h5>
                    <p>Good question! The truth is, gamification is not a novel concept at all—despite the term being a trendy buzzword everyone seems to be throwing around these days. Gamification in itself does not carry any ethical issues as its purpose is to bring an element of fun into normal mundane tasks, just as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Qjuegtiyc" target="_blank">Yu-Kai Chou</a> said:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><i>"I foresaw a world where there's no longer a divide between what you have to do and what you want to do..."</i></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And what that basically means is that gamification could be the key in bridging the "needs" and the "wants", by changing the way we perceive our motivations for doing what we do.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For example, some of us might find quizzes to be a bore (or a chore), but when you introduce leaderboards and a points system just like in <a href="https://kahoot.com/" target="_blank">Kahoot!</a>, we tend to find more people being engaged even if they had no idea what the quiz was about.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>However, the ethical issues arise when gamification is being used for control and addiction—which at times can be dangerous because its designed to be unnoticeable. As a great way of getting users engaged, gamification has been overused and abused in design to drive up screen time and usage KPIs; which only benefit the companies while disregarding the wellbeing of the users.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h5>What can I get out of the <b>Gamified.</b> experience?</h5>
                    <p>Through the Gamified. process, users will be able to receive suggestions and references on how to approach gamification in their project. This is done by defining the requirements of their project through understanding the desired Goals, Player types of the target audience and Motivations for engagement.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This project aims to be a reliable and accessible starting point for designers of all levels to understand the core concepts and possibilities of gamification in design.</p>
