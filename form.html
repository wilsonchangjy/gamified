                            <p>There are plenty more gamification tools and frameworks out there that may offer different solutions to your project, as well as many other nuances that cannot be factored into this general gamification workflow.

They aim to attain 100% completion on the system. They do this for themselves and are probably not that bothered with showing off to others about it.

                                    They will compete, but as a way to become better than others.  May also be motivated by status as a representation of their personal achievement. Achievers need a system that will enrich them and lead them towards <b>Mastery</b>.

                                    According to Yu-Kai Chou, Epic Meaning & Calling is the Core Drive where a player believes that they are doing something greater than themselves or that they were “chosen” to do something.
                                    <br>
                                    A symptom of this is a player that devotes a lot of their time to maintaining a forum or helping to create things for the entire community (think Wikipedia or Open Source projects).

                                    This also comes into play when someone has “Beginner's Luck”; an effect where people believe they have some type of gift that others don't or believe they were “lucky” to get that amazing sword at the very beginning of the game.

                                    According to Yu-Kai Chou, Development & Accomplishment is the internal drive of making progress, developing skills, and eventually overcoming challenges. The word “challenge” here is very important, as a badge or trophy without a challenge is not meaningful at all.
                                    <br>
                                    This is also the core drive that is the easiest to design for and coincidently is where most of the PBLs: points, badges, leaderboards mostly focus on.

                                <span class="mouseover" id="tooltip-creativity">
                                    According to Yu-Kai Chou, Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback is when users are engaged in a creative process where they have to repeatedly figure things out and try different combinations.
                                    <br>
                                    People not only need ways to express their creativity, but they need to be able to see the results of their creativity, receive feedback, and respond in turn.
                                    <br>
                                    This is why playing with Legos and painting are fun in-and-of themselves and often become Evergreen Mechanics, where a game-designer no longer needs to continuously add more content to keep the activity fresh and engaging.

                                <span class="mouseover" id="tooltip-ownership">
                                    According to Yu-Kai Chou, Ownership & Possession is the drive where users are motivated because they feel like they own something. When a player feels ownership, they innately want to make what their own better and own even more. 
                                    <br>
                                    Besides being the major core drive for wanting to accumulate wealth, this deals with many virtual goods or virtual currencies within systems.
                                    <br>
                                    Also, if a person spends a lot of time to customize their profile or avatar, she automatically feels more ownership towards it too. Finally, this is also the core drive that makes collecting stamps or puzzle pieces fun.
                                </span>
                                <span class="mouseover" id="tooltip-social">
                                    According to Yu-Kai Chou, Social Influence & Relatedness/Envy incorporates all the social elements that drive people, including: mentorship, acceptance, social responses, companionship, as well as competition and envy.
                                    <br>
                                    When you see a friend that is amazing at some skill or owns something extraordinary, you become driven to reach the same level. Also, it includes the drive we have to draw closer to people, places, or events that we can relate to.
                                    <br>
                                    If you see a product that reminds you of your childhood, the sense of nostalgia would likely increase the odds of you buying the product. This Core Drive is relatively well-studied too, as many companies these days are putting a lot of priority on optimizing their online social strategies.

                                <span class="mouseover" id="tooltip-scarcity">
                                    According to Yu-Kai Chou, Scarcity & Impatience is the drive of wanting something because you can't have it. Many games have Appointment Dynamics (come back 2 hours later to get your reward); the fact that people can't get something right now motivates them to think about it all day long.
                                    <br>
                                    This is the Core Drive utilized by Facebook when it first started: at first it was just for Harvard. Then it opened up to a few other prestigious schools, and eventually all colleges. When it finally opened up to everyone, many people wanted to join because they previously couldn't get in it.
                                </span>
                                <span class="mouseover" id="tooltip-curiosity">
                                    According to Yu-Kai Chou, Unpredictability & Curiosity is generally a harmless drive of wanting to find out what will happen next. If you don't know what's going to happen, your brain is engaged and you think about it often. Many people watch movies or read novels because of this drive.
                                    <br>
                                    However, this drive is also the primary factor behind gambling addiction. Also, this core drive is utilized whenever a company runs a sweepstake or lottery program to engage users.
                                    <br>
                                    The very controversial Skinner Box experiments, where an animal irrationally presses a lever frequently because of unpredictable results, are exclusively referring to the core drive of Unpredictability & Curiosity, although many have misunderstood it as the driver behind points, badges, and leaderboard mechanics in general.
                                </span>
                                <span class="mouseover" id="tooltip-loss">
                                    According to Yu-Kai Chou, the Loss & Avoidance core drive is based upon the avoidance of something negative happening. On a small scale, it could be to avoid losing previous work. On a larger scale, it could be to avoid admitting that everything you did up to this point was useless because you are now quitting.
                                    <br>
                                    Also, opportunities that are fading away have a strong utilization of this Core Drive, because people feel like if they didn't act immediately, they would lose the opportunity to act forever.
