# Gamified.
is an AI-powered web project dedicated to providing designers with harnessing the knowledge and tools of implementing Gamification into their projects.

Users are guided through a process of defining their project requirements and will be given suggestions and prompts on how to include Gamified elements into their project's ecosystem.

A complete documentation of the project can be found on my website (https://wilsonchangjy.super.site/my-projects/gamified).

# Technical Considerations
Gamified. is currently live and is being hosted on GitHub pages at https://gamified.fun.

This project is developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (including JQuery). Some external features include:
- OpenAI's ChatGPT API https://platform.openai.com/, running both davinci-003 and gpt-3.5-turbo
- Spline https://spline.design/, for interactive 3D objects in lieu of flat illustrations (Corporate Memphis is way overabused)
- Chart.js https://www.chartjs.org/, for visualising Karma Points based on the Octalysis framework
